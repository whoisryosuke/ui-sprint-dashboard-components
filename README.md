# Dashboard Components

This project was a design sprint taking [a free Sketch resource on Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/free-ui-designs) and converting it to React UI components.

Each component is styled using CSS in JS through Styled Components. The app is not actually meant to function, just to serve as a UI kit.

## Development

`npm run start`

Built on Create React App and StorybookJS. Storybook is used to build components in isolation without making extra pages in CRA.

## Progress

- [] Report/Feedback
- [] Logout Widget
